            <p>This project was the result of work I did during the summer of 2017 as part of CMU's HCII Research Experience for Undergraduates. The overarching goal for this project was to understand individuals' habits when it comes to browser usage.
            </p>
            <p>While there are certain common behaviors completed within browsers, such as  online shopping or making comparisons between different pages, our browsers don't currently best support such behaviors. As a result, some individuals are led to behaviors such as tabhoarding.
            </p>
            <p>To better understand common behaviors with browser usage, I designed and ran contextual inquiry studies that was meant to dig deeper into individuals' underlying reasons for tabhoarding. For example, we found out that individuals sometimes keep pages around in their browsers even when they're not sure if they are valuable because they do not want to waste the efforts it took to find those pages.
