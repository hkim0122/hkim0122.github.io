            <p>This document design project was the first assignment I completed for my first HCI course I took at CMU, so it is especially important to me in some ways. For this project, I designed a theoretical document that would be produced for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection. The document was written with two different stakeholders in, so there was the added challenge of having to balance out conflicting interests while still presenting an aesthetically pleasing and beautiful document.
            </p>
            <p>
            I used InDesign to create the document for this project, and as the Adobe Creative Suite was not software I had used before, there was definitely a learning curve. Also, since it was my first HCI class, I got a taste of the program's approach-while the concepts were taught broadly, it was up to me to figure out the specifics of how to use the actual InDesign software.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even though this project doesn't typically fall into the category of an HCI project, it was fun because it was one fo the first times when I had to pay attention to things such as typography and font sizes, as well as the hierarchy of a document.
