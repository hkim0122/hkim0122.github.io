            <p> For this project for Interaction Design Studio 2, my team and I were tasked with using social design to engage the community. We had to identify a social problem, and our team picked the quality of tap water in Pittsburgh as the problem, since everyone in the Pittsburgh community utilizes Pittsburgh tap water in some way.
            </p>
            <p> We had to consider the different stakeholders that either contribute or are affected by Pittsburgh water systems, such as PWSA (The Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority), the city of Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh locals.
            </p>
            <p> Since we were supposed to work on a social problem for this project, we ultimately had to design a brainstorm session that would occur in the community, and the piece of work I chose to show here is the poster for the hypothetical co-design session we would hold.
